		<p>From Neville Miles to Matthew Brett, 10 June 2020</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.. Frederick Bruce was born in 1932 Dec 23rd, Mum and Dad were married 24 feb 1932. The reason you couldn’t find Bryan Stephen bell b1914 d1981 was obviously the spelling . Edgar John Miles’ parents were Thomas Miles and Sarah bush of Warminster . Mum was not born in Eng ‘only Sydney Marshall Bell ( confirm b later ) (( going to meet one of his sons hopefully on our trip)) and Robert Alexander b 12/07/1905 were born in Eng. Oh when Syd was born they lived at 162 Southfield Rd Acton. Denys i’m pretty sure was named after the main church the Miles’ worshiped at in the Devices Warminster at St. Denys …</p>
