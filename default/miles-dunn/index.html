<p>Last night’s New Zealand News (Per Press Association) Auckland, last night:</p>
<p>An action for £500 and for £1500 damages was commenced against Ernest Houswell Bennet by Edgar J Miles and Catherine Harriet Miles for injuries alleged to have been sustained in a motor car and trap collision in March last.

<p><a href="https://www.myheritage.com/names/maureen_miles">This myheritage page</a> adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They had one daughter: Jill Maureen Brown. Mona passed away on month day 1990, at age 80.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jill Maureen married Graham Noel Brown - see <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Kenneth-Robinson/6000000040732345917">this Geni entry</a>.</p>
<p>Mona’s marriage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1932/8544 Mona Maureen Miles Kenneth Mervyn Robinson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1990/44432 Robinson Mona Maureen 25 September 1910</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mona Maureen appears to be the daughter of Catherine Harriet’s youngest sister, Ethel Eileen Bracey (nee Dunn).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myheritage.com/names/eileen_bracey">MyHeritage on Eileen Bracey</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eileen Ethel Bracey was born on month day 1887, at birth place, to James Dunn and Mary Dunn.</p>
<p>Eileen had 6 siblings: Florence Charlotte Moor, James William Copley Dunn and 4 other siblings.</p>
<p>Eileen married Alfred Joshua Bracey in 1910, at age 22 at marriage place. They had one daughter: Mona Maureen Robinson. Eileen passed away on month day 1910, at age 23 at death place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed there’s this entry for deaths in NZ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1910/8055Bracey Eileen Ethel 23Y</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Mona’s mother died in childbirth.</p>
<p>Mona’s NZ “birth record” is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1917/14934 Miles Mona Maureen Catherine Harriett Edgar John</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is almost certainly her modified birth record, replacing her original birth record when she was adopted.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz/timeline">NZ records site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1915 Re-registration of the birth of any child “subject to an adoption order” introduced. Original birth entry closed. New entry registered stating adoptive details.</p>
